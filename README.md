# FBLA_App
Hello Judges! This repository is for my submission, David Kopala, to the 2015 Distrct FBLA competition.
In this repo, you will find the actual app for my submission. If this is not what you were looking for and are searching
for my API repository, you can find it here at: https://github.com/QuantumMatter/FBLA_DB_API.

##Introduction

My app is called "The App of Life," and is a new social media app app focused on educating and involving people in the
world around them. For the district competition, users are able to sign in and sign up for groups.

The FBLA topic for this year was improving communication within your school, and I created an app that does that. Social
media and education have now become intertwined in an intricate design that will soon be leading the way people get their
information. We need to start developing a comprehensive program that combines aspects of business, community, and
education in one innovative, insightful, and exciting interface. I believe that my app has laid down the framework
to start the revolution of this type of apps.

## Instructions For Testing

I developed my app on Xcode for the iPhone 5 and a 4.7 inch screen Unfortunately, I do not posses an Apple Developer
Membership, and you can't test this on a PC. This means that we're going to have to do this the old fashioned way on
OS X.

### Step One: Cloning

First, clone the repository to a place on your computer; remember this location, we'll use it next.

### Step Two: Opening

Second, open the file location where the repository was cloned to, and navigate to the .xcodeproj file located under
FBLA_App\App of Life\App of Life.xcodeproj. Double click on it to open it.

### Step Three: Simulating

Once Xcode has opened and loaded the project, click on the "Play" button in the upper left part of the window. If
it prompts you to choose a target device, choose iPhone 6.

### Step Four: Sign In

Open the navigation drawer by clicking the upper left button on the menu bar. Then, click sign in at the bottom, and
sign in with the following credentials:
Userername - Test
Password - Test

### Step Five: Grade!

Thank you so much for taking the time to look at project, I really appreciate it. Now, it's time to be amazed, inspired,
and breath-taken by the wonders to behold.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience problems while running the app, don't give up; there could be a problem with Xcode.

While I was building, there were time where custom objects would return as a "O key/object pair." If this happens,
try restarting Xcode. If that doesn't work, try restarting your computer.

Most times, a general power cycle will fix the problem.

## Final Comments

Thank you so much again for volunteering your time, everybody really APPreciates it.

### Current Version

If you feel like looking at or grading the most current version, please email me at davidk@ihcconline.com and just
let me know. I would be more than happy to send to you my latest work.

### Future

In the future, whether or not I even make it past the district level, I plan on finishing my app and start marketing
it. This app really could lead the way for similar projects from companies like Twitter, Facebook, and especiall Google.
When the time comes, I will begin partnering with local businesses to start growing my visibility in the community,
and then either try to sell the app or take all the way.
